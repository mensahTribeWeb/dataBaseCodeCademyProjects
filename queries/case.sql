-- Case

-- A CASE statement allows us to create different outputs 
-- (usually in the SELECT statement). It is SQLâ€™s way of 
-- handling if-then logic.

-- If the population is below 1000000, then it is Fantastic.
-- If the population is below 500000, then it is Poorly Received.
-- Else, Avoid at All Costs.
